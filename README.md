# Genetic-Algorithms-Travelling-Salesman-Problem

## Implementation of genetic algorithm for the travelling salesman problem.
This project was developed for my end of degree project in mathematics. It aims to show how one can apply a metaheuristic to a croncrete problem and obtain reasonable solutions. Two solution representations have been used: permutational and ordinal. It used the library PyGAD to run the algorithm. For this, custom crossover and mutation operators have been used. By running the main.py file one can save the performance of a genetic algorithm over 24 TSP instances taken from the TSPLIB library.
